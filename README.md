About this software
===================

Pardus Sweetener is a Google Chrome extension that enhances the user
interface of the online space game Pardus http://www.pardus.at/

THIS SOFTWARE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE.
Install at your own risk.

The main feature is an audible combat notifier, which Firefox users
have had for long, but was unavailable for Chrome.  Besides that, it
includes functionality already available through other means, but as
Greasemonkey scripts, which is not optimal for Chrome.  And anyway
those scripts lack easy configuration from an options screen.

Features
========

This is the full list of features planned for the first public
release:

 * Audible alarm on user-configurable game events
 * Desktop notifications on user-configurable game events
 * Clocks for different "ticks", a la Pardus Clock
 * Robot autofill in combat screens
 * Missile autoselect in combat screens
 * Rounds autoselect in combat screens
 * Links to attack and trade with other ships in the nav screen
 * Links to bulletin board, black market, etc. in the nav screen
