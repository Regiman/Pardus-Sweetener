This is a Google Chrome extension which enhances the user interface of
the online space game Pardus.

THIS SOFTWARE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE.
Install at your own risk.

The main feature is an audible combat notifier, which Firefox users
have had for long, but was unavailable for Chrome.  Besides that, it
includes functionality already available through other means, but as
Greasemonkey scripts, which is not optimal for Chrome, and anyway lack
easy configuration from an options screen.

This is the full list of features planned for the first public
release:

 * Audible alarm on user-configurable game events
 * Desktop notifications on user-configurable game events
 * Clocks for different "ticks", a la Pardus Clock
 * A robot autofiller in the combat screen
 * A missile autoselecter in the combat screen
